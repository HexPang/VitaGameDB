Taking place in an original 1940\u2019s inspired alternative universe where the bizarre blends with a slice of old time Americana to produce Hope Falls; a morally bankrupt town ruled by violent organized crime and populated with mutants spawned from toxic waste; Dead Head Fred\u2122 tell the story of Fred Neuman, just your average Private Investigator... average that is until he gets a little too close to the shady dealings of a powerful mob boss.  Now Fred finds himself without his memory, without his friends and, most disturbingly, without his head \u2013 left in its place only a brain, two eyes and a jar to preserve them. It\u2019s from this point that his journey of revenge begins.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\u2122 and \u00a9 2006-2007 Vicious Cycle Software, Inc. Published exclusively by D3Publisher Inc. worldwide.
