It has the same basic concept as other strategy RPGs, but uses many unique features and enhancements that make this game unprecedented. The following are some of the unique features of Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGeo Panel - Is a group of stat altering elemental properties that are placed upon certain parts of the battlefields. When there are one or more colored square panels on the battle grid, it means an element  can affect that area.  The effect can boost or reduce your unit's stats.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGeo Cube - A new addition to the PSP\u00ae version, Geo Cubes are magic items that add more depth to multi-player battles.  You can use the various Geo Cubes to enhance your abilities, summon monsters, or even attack your enemies with them. \r\n<br><br>\r\nDemon Gadgets - Are randomly generated items that appear on the battlefield.  By acquiring these gadgets, you can power your units up.  Some demon gadgets can level your unit up by 30 levels at once.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nTransmigration - A form of reincarnation that allows you to start over from level 1, but your unit will grow stronger than before.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u00a92009 NIPPON ICHI SOFTWARE INC.
