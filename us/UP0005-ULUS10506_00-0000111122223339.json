Play as Cecilia, a cleric, or as Levant, a knight. Enjoy an extraordinary level of polish providing quick, fun battles, flexible strategy, and virtually no load times with an option that allows you to install the UMD\u2122 game onto a Memory Stick Duo\u2122. Approximately 20 minutes of anime movie cutscenes beautifully highlight the epic story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong ago, Norvia, Goddess of Creation, used the Holy Vessel, a divine chalice charged with all Force to create life and the Divinities. Then, Delgaia, God of Destruction, brought about a calamity, intending to return all Force to the Holy Vessel and Berge to the void. The Divinities sacrificed themselves to seal Delgaia deep within the earth. As Berge lay in ruin, Norvia made a covenant to restore it on one condition. When the Hour of Judgment came to pass, the world would have to decide its path: creation or destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a92010 ATLUS Developed by Sting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
