Ancient Game Treasures: Mill includes three varieties of games from the Mill family including Three Men's Morris, Six Men's Morris, and Nine Men's Morris.  Align three of your game pieces in a straight line to form a \u201cMill\u201d with the reward of removing one of your opponent\u2019s pieces from the board.  The game starts with players taking turns strategically placing game pieces on the board.  After all of the pieces have been placed, players take turns sliding game pieces to open spots on the board next to their existing pieces.  When a player has only three game pieces left, their pieces can \"jump\" around the board to any open space.  The first player to remove all but two of their opponent\u2019s pieces or trap all of their opponent\u2019s pieces so they cannot move wins the game.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDeveloped and published by G1M2, LLC.  \u00a9 2011 G1M2, LLC.
